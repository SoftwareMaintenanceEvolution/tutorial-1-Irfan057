# Introduction
Hi! I'm Irfanur Rahman, a student in the Software Maintenance
and Evolution course.
 I expect to learn how to effectively manage, update, and improve existing software systems to ensure they remain efficient over time.
- **Fun fact**: - I love playing and watching football particularly Chelsea Team.
                - I like to read books during my free time.
                - I really like Coffee and Grean tea
                - I like to go for hike whenever I feel adventurous.
                 
- **Course expectations**: To gain hands-on experience in
maintaining and evolving software.
